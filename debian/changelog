    dwarf_attr(), and dwarf_hasattr_integrate() instead of dwarf_hasattr().

    got lost.  (Closes: #404054)
  * First cast main to an intptr_t before casting it to a 64 bit int.
    Directly casting from a pointer to 64 bit int gives a warning
    on 32 bit systems (with gcc-4.2).  (Closes: #431455)
  * Also check for /proc/$$.

elfutils (0.123-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kurt Roeckx ]

  * Add backend support for arm: adding regs and retval.
    Thanks to Eugeniy Meshcheryakov <eugeniy.meshcheryakov@googlemail.com>
  * Add backend support for hppa, thanks to
    Eugeniy Meshcheryakov <eugeniy.meshcheryakov@googlemail.com>
  * Add some missing ELFOSABI_* and EM_* to elf.h

  [ Christian Aichinger ]
  * Fix sparc backend retval
  * Add mips backend.
  * Rewrite the static backend so making changes to the backends
    is easier.

elfutils (0.122-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kurt Roeckx ]
  * The backends init functions should be functions, not pointers
    to functions.  Also thanks to Eugeniy Meshcheryakov
    for pointing out the same.  This should fix the segmentation faults
    seen on ia64.
  * When doing x && y &, bash retuns the pid for x, while the script
    expected the one for y.  Other shells I've tried return that of y.
    As a result the run-native-test.sh keeps a "native" process running.
    Removed the &&, so it always gets the correct pid.  (Closes: #382758)
  * Fix endiannes problems for opening files of your own endiannes
    when not avoiding unaligned access.  This didn't affect
    i386 and amd64.
